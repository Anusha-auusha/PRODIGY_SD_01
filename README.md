# PRODIGY_SD_01
Task 1 - Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales

# Temperature Converter

This is a simple Python program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program prompts the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It then converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the results.

## Project Overview

Temperature conversion is a common task in various scientific and engineering applications. This project provides a straightforward and user-friendly Python script to perform these conversions. Users can input a temperature value and specify its unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin), and the program will output the equivalent temperatures in the other two units. This tool is useful for anyone needing quick and accurate temperature conversions without the need for complex calculations or online converters.

## Features

- Converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
- Converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.
- Converts from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `temperature_converter.py` file to your local machine.

### Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `temperature_converter.py` file is located.
3. Run the program using the following command:

   ```sh
   python temperature_converter.py

## Results

The program effectively converts temperature values between the three units of measurement. It handles user input robustly and provides accurate conversions to two decimal places. The example provided in the usage section demonstrates the clear and concise output format of the program.

#### Output
Temperature Converter
Enter the temperature value: 25
Enter the unit of the temperature (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, K for Kelvin): C
25.0°C is equal to 77.00°F and 298.15K

## Conclusion

This temperature converter program serves as a handy tool for quick and accurate temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Its simplicity and ease of use make it suitable for a wide range of users, from students and educators to professionals in scientific fields. The program can be extended with additional features or integrated into larger applications as needed.
